For our timer application, we have a single module dependency - pyglet. The rest of the required modules are included in default python installs.  Python packages are installed with `pip`.  Install pyglet as below:

```sudo pip3 install pyglet```

(Note that we are using ```pip3``` to install Python 3 modules. Python 2 will shortly be ending active development and entering an extended maintenance-only phase.)
